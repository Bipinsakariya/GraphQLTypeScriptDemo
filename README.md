### Following things are implemented related to graphql.
- Apollo code-gen to create typings for graphql query, mutation to get a typesafe environment and less buggy code.(Logic for the codegen is in codegen.yml in the roort of the project)

- Used apollo client with auto generated hooks to make the code more compact and cleaner

- Used authLink for auth_tokens and uploadLink for upload image and files to the server.

Note: Android, iOS and node_modules folders are removed for size compatibility.
